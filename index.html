                <p>Robert Scott Lazar (born January 26, 1959)is an American conspiracy theorist and self-proclaimed
                    physicist who claims he was hired in the late 1980s to reverse-engineer extraterrestrial technology.
                    This work supposedly occurred at a secret site called "S-4", a subsidiary installation allegedly
                    located
                    several kilometers south of the United States Air Force facility popularly known as <a
